1. Intro
	- What is the name of your language?: 
		- Nam's Quick PP (with Parsons and Puppo)
	- What is the language’s paradigm?: 
		- Imperative
	- (optional) is there anything especially unique or interesting: 
		- It's written by 4 pretty awesome people! :)

2. Design
	- What features does your language include?:
		- Basic data types and operations, conditionals, recursion/loops, variables/local names, procedures/functions with 		      arguments, stack manipulation operations.
		- Static type system (2) and Strings and operations (1).
	- What level does each feature fall under and how did you determine this?:
		- Strings and operations, as well as array data-type and operations, fall under core features as they are crucial to he expressiveness of our language.
		- Strings and operations fall under syntactic sugar and (??) static type system fall under library-level.
	- What are the safety properties of your language?:
		- Static type safety.

3. Implementation
	- What semantic domains did you choose for your language? How did you decide on these?:
		- Strings, Booleans, Floats and Integers. We chose these because they seem the most practical and fundamental to any language, especially imperative languages such as C.
	- Are there any unique or interesting aspects of your implementation you’d like to describe?:
		- N/A
