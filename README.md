It will have basic functions such as printing strings, returning a boolean, and simple mathematical functions.

3. How to execute example programs in our language:
  - If your language implementation is intended to be run from GHCi, which module should be loaded?:
      - NQPP.hs

      - DoTheDiv
      - Etc.
