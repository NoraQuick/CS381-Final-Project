# CS381-Final-Project

1. Team members' names and ONIDs:
  - Thien Nam (namt)
  - Zach Parsons (parsonsz)
  - Luke Puppo (puppol)
  - Nora Quick (quickn)

2. Intro to our language:
  Our language is called Namâ€™s Quick PP and it is an imperative language. It will have features such as strings and operations as well as static typing on top of the overall required features. It will be like a simple C program where the user will be able to do simple mathmatics with ints and floats and where possible bools and strings as well. It will also handle if and while loops.
(??)list and array data types and operations on top of the overall required features. It will have basic functions such as printing strings, returning a boolean, and simple mathematical functions.

3. How to execute example programs in our language:
  - If your language implementation is intended to be run from GHCi, which module should be loaded?:
      - NQPP.hs
  - If your language implementation is intended to be run from the command line, what command should be executed?:
      - 
      - (??)Since our types are represented (shown as t in these examples) as CI(int), CB(bool), CF(float), or CS(string), for:
      - Add, you type "smt (t n :+: t n)
      - Subtract, you type "smt (t n :-: t n)
      - Multiply, you type "smt (t n :*: t n)
      - Divide, you type "smt (t n :/: t n)
      - Etc.
      - Obviously, all of these operators work for intergers and floats, but for bools and strings, only addition will work.

  - Include precise commands needed to execute both your good examples and bad examples together with expected output.:
  	- (??)We have 6 examples. They are labeled ex1 through ex8. To run one call the example you want.
