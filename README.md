# CS381-Final-Project

1. Team members' names and ONIDs:
  - Thien Nam (namt)
  - Zach Parsons (parsonsz)
  - Luke Puppo (puppol)
  - Nora Quick (quickn)

2. Intro to our language:
  Our language is called Namâ€™s Quick PP and it is an imperative language. It will have features such as strings and operations as well as static typing on top of the overall required features. It will be like a simple C program where the user will be able to do simple mathmatics with ints and floats and where possible bools and strings as well. It will also handle if and while loops.

3. How to execute example programs in our language:
  - If your language implementation is intended to be run from GHCi, which module should be loaded?:
      - NQPP.hs
  - If your language implementation is intended to be run from the command line, what command should be executed?:
      - N/A

  - Include precise commands needed to execute both your good examples and bad examples together with expected output.:
  	- For the good examples please use exprog, ifprog, whileprog, and stringProg. 
    - For the bad examples please use fail1 and fail2.
